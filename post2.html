		<h3>Accelerated use of Microsoft Dynamics NAV within the Antenna Company B.V.</h3>

  <blockquote>
    At Harvard, five different guys in my class, told me they would one day be the President of the United States. Four of them were later killed in motel shoot-outs. The other ones briefly hosted "Blues-clue's" before dying senselessly in yet another motel shoutout. Your path at 22 will not necessarily be your path at 32 or 42. One's dream is constantly evolving, rising and falling, changing course. Well, I am here to tell you, that whatever you think your dream is now, it will probably change. And that's okay. But the point is this: it is our failure, to become our perceived ideal, that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It's not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right, your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound reinvention.

		<h4>Situation</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>
						I was working as an intern at a tech-company in the reputed high-tech campus of Eindhoven, in close vicinity of Philips Research Eindhoven (Headquarters). I went in with a hands-on problem-solving mentality to find the best possible solution to problems they threw at me. I truly wanted to deliver a working-solution and not just a concept because I did that in my previous internship where I delivered a concept of a custom CRM with mock-ups. Besides my assignment was quite clear to me. I had an implementation project for five stakeholders at hand and I had to satisfy the requirements of each, including CEO and COO.
						</li>
						<li>My skills at that time were mostly based on engineering and business processes. Facilitation skills like holding workshops, stakeholder-management, and working with very senior individuals in rank were required. Further analysis of the initial requirements brought up the technical feasibility of the task, not to mention the associated costs. I also had to work within deadlines. I had 90 working days to deliver.</li>
						<li>It was one the most intense learning opportunities for me as I was about to pivot quite heavily towards the path I am on right now. It created a looming feeling of having much more to do than just solving the problems. This feeling lasted until the very end of my MSc. program in the UE and it have been the driving force of my formal education ever-since.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Task</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>I had to accelerate the usage of their ERP system â€“ Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2016. They asked for various changes within the platform, customized to their own business process. They also asked for analytics and data to run KPIs like Gross Margin %, Backlog, Orders (open and closed) etc.
						</li>
						
		</ul>
		<h4>Action</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>
						I conducted preliminary research on the possibilities of how to extract the data from the system to form the KPIs and its formulas.
						</li>
						<li>I created a SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) detailing all the steps to take in exact order, to achieve those KPIs.</li>
						<li>I created a dashboard with the KPIs presented in IBCS format.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>
						The company appreciated my effort and gave it the pass. It was an excellent opportunity for me to experience professionalism and carry on the experience and prepare for the next project in a consulting company, which I consider having provided me with the best project management experience.
						</li>
