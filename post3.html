		<h3>Zetes CRM Automation and Optimization - A Scenario Analysis</h3>

		<h4>Situation</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>
						It was my first time ever in an internship role. My engineering school accredits professional experiences gained for a period of 90 days. Within this timeframe, I had to employ my acquired skills to solve a set of business problems associated with my chosen domain: ICT(Information and Communication Technology)
						</li>
						<li>My mentor was then Marketing Manager, and I was working directly under her. I was working on my project and simultaneously performing any other duties assigned. With no prior experience at hand, I had to go in with my core values like sincerity, dedication, a service-oriented work ethic and my ability to learn quickly on the job.</li>
						<li>The challenge was to eradicate tedious data-entry processes and identify standardized methods of loading data into their Salesforce platform without resorting to manually entering it into a spreadsheet and using tools like Dataloader.io to bulk upload the information.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Task</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>
						My core assignment involved finding ways to remove any intermediate steps in their Salesforce data-entry process. Specifically, leads that were sourced from non-electronic sources like business cards, tradeshows, and conferences had to be entered into the system manually.
						</li>
						<li>I was also asked to perform duties like creating landing pages for their marketing campaigns using HTML and CSS, banners, and posters for their customer events.</li>
						
					</ul>
		<h4>Action</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>
						I created a conceptual design using high-fidelity mock-ups for a software module that is connected to their Salesforce environment.
						</li>
						<li>I created landing pages for marketing campaigns in the Salesforce platform and other marketing instruments like banners and posters for their customer events.</li>
					</ul>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<ul>
						<li>
						To my delight, the result was quite a success (a score of 9 out of 10). My primary stakeholders including the university were quite pleased with all my research products and recommendations.
						</li>
						
					</ul>
