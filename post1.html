		<h3>Web application for managing clientele information in OCS Consulting.</h3>

		<h4>Project Background.</h4>

		<p>The project was initiated by OCS-Consulting B.V. located in 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands in 2018 to better manage, analyze and investigate thier clientele information. Their business involves supplying tools and services like on-site staff secondment, consultancy and infrastructure support services for corporations and small businesses with their expertise in the fields of Project Management, Business Analysis, Business Intelligence, and Testing and Developing technologies with SASÂ® Software. To further improve their services, OCS-Consulting decided to start with a project-based approach to managing this internal process of handling clientele assignments and the information that comes from them.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Clientele assignments are services provided by OCS-Consulting B.V. under legally binding contracts. These contracts hold information about their clients and the terms of the services provided by OCS-Consulting. Further, more information is stored in spreadsheets like duration of the contract and its number, consultants assigned etc. The internal process of handling clientele information on management reports that provide an overview of all assignments is done with spreadsheets. The contracts are created in MS-Word.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Project Objective.</h4>
		<br>
		<p>With its growth over time the company found problems with managing its clientele information. They needed to take measures to solve them. Firstly, manual handling of these assignments involves paperwork and the use of spreadsheets can be error-prone and tedious. To an extent this can be effective but as the company grows this becomes challenging to maintain. Secondly, without a standardized system, the consultants at OCS-Consulting needed to device their own method of managing their assignments. Further, variation as to how clientele information documents are made can result into the problem of diminished quality of data, creating difficulty for later reference.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The objective of the project is to create an efficient system of managing their clientele information using a data driven web-application. The company takes a project-based approach to purpose this as an opportunity to investigate how to efficiently record their clientele assignments and standardize the process within the company. Further, they want to investigate if this data holds any valuable information when subjected to a business intelligence or a data-visualization tool. Specifically, the company wants to know if the web-application developed for this purpose can contribute to finding valuable information, ease of reference and a more efficient process.</p>
